# mangadex_openapi

Python API to mangadex.org, generated using [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).

## Usage

It is possible to use this package directly, but I strongly suggest you use the [higher-level wrapper](https://github.com/ongyx/mangadex) instead. The generated code *may* change at any time because of changes to the underlying OpenAPI document.

## Versioning

The version of this package will always be in the format 0.y.z (because it may change any time at the discretion of the MangaDex devs).
This package version does not follow the API version as the generated code may need to be patched because of API updates.

## Docs

See [here](api_docs/README.md).
